# Treact cloned template

This project is an exact copy of another website [( click to show original website )](https://www.github.com/octokatherine).

Treact is a hotel reservation front-end template.

I worked **extremely carefully** on the design of this website with  help of ( ReactJs, MaterialUi, with many more packages).

My goal in building this template was to demonstrate my abilities and to challenge myself to build a sophisticated website, then alhamdullilah i'm doing it very well.
